# Contributing Guide

This guide will discuss how one can contribute back to this project. First, you will need to clone this repository locally. 

```
git clone https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure.git
```

You will need to setup a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) in order to clone via HTTPS since git over ssh is disabled. 

The typical contribution process will be as follows:

```
git checkout -b <featureX>
git add <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>
git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
git push 
```

Please create a feature branch, add the files that need to be changed, commit and push your changes. Next [create a merge request](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/merge_requests/new) to [main](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/tree/main) branch. 

If you want to reproduce the steps in the CI, we encourage you review the [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml) and run the instructions to recreate the environment.

Once you clone this repo locally, you can source the [setup-env.sh](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/blob/main/setup-env.sh) script. 

```
cd spack-infrastructure
source setup-env.sh
```

This script will create a python environment where you can perform spack builds. This script will set `CI_PROJECT_DIR` to root of spack-infrastructure project.

```
(spack-pyenv) siddiq90@login31> echo $CI_PROJECT_DIR
/global/homes/s/siddiq90/gitrepos/software.nersc.gov/spack-infrastructure
```

## Troubleshooting CI builds

First you will need to review the pipeline build in https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/pipeline_schedules and login as `e4s` user on the appropriate system. At top of pipeline you will see location where project was cloned typically this would be in **$CFS/m3503**. The content would look something like 
```
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /global/cfs/cdirs/m3503/ci/oGV2kxLA/0/NERSC/spack-infrastructure/.git/
```

You will need to navigate to the directory and then repeat the steps specified in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to reproduce the issue. 

## How to add a new E4S stack 

All spack configuration are stored in [spack-configs](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/tree/main/spack-configs) directory, so if you want to add a new spack configuration please create a new directory to store your spack configuration. You can use the directory format `<site>-<spack version>` to map a spack version to a particular system so `perlmutter-v0.22` refers to Spack v0.22 for Perlmutter. 

You will need to create one or more gitlab job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to ensure gitlab can run the pipeline. We recommend you create a [scheduled pipeline](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/pipeline_schedules/new) in order to run job on a scheduled basis. The scheduled pipeline must define name `PIPELINE_NAME` with name of gitlab job to run.  

The production pipelines should not run via scheduled pipeline, instead they should be run manually via [web interface](https://gitlab.nersc.gov/nersc/pem/spack-infrastructure/-/pipelines/new). The production pipeline should only be run when one need to redeploy the entire stack due to rebuild. 

## Building User Documentation

The documentation is built using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and hosted on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/). We have
enabled [Preview Documentation from Pull Requests](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html).
When a pull request or push event occurs, the documentation will be rebuilt and hosted. This allows us to preview the changes during the review process.

If you want to build documentation locally, use the following steps:

1. Create a python virtual environment and activate the environment
```
python3 -m venv $HOME/nersc-spack
source $HOME/nersc-spack/bin/activate
```

2. Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r docs/requirement.txt
```

3. Build the documentation

```
cd docs
make clean
make html
```

Shown below is a typical build for documentation

```

The HTML pages are in _build/html.
```

The documentation page can be accessible by opening the file `_build/html/index.html` in your browser. 
Alternatively you can use the `open` command from your terminal

```
open _build/html/index.html
```

Sphinx will read a configuration file, [conf.py](https://github.com/NERSC/spack-infrastructure/blob/main/docs/conf.py), when building the documentation

Please refer to the [Configuration section of the Sphinx documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html) for more details.
