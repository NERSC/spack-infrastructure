Spack Configuration
===================

This page will show all of our Spack configuration files (`spack.yaml`) used for our production deployments. The
Spack configuration located in `spack-configs <https://github.com/NERSC/spack-infrastructure/tree/main/spack-configs>`_ directory
organized by each subdirectory.

At NERSC, we are building the `Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) <https://e4s.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_ which
is a collection of open-source products software packages part of Spack ecosystem for running scientific applications on high-performance
computing (HPC) platforms. We acquire the Spack configuration from https://github.com/E4S-Project/e4s upon release with list of specs and reference
Spack branch in order to build the E4S stack. Please see our E4S documentation at https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/e4s/


Perlmutter Spack Develop
-------------------------

This Spack configuration will build all packages using Spack `develop` branch on weekly basis. All specs are specified
without any version in order to let Spack build the latest package which will evolve over time.

You may add the mirror into your spack environment by running::

    spack mirror add perlmutter-spack-buildcache /global/common/software/spackecp/mirrors/perlmutter-spack-develop

Or you can explicitly add the following lines into your spack.yaml

    .. code-block:: yaml

          mirrors:
            perlmutter-spack-buildcache: file:///global/common/software/spackecp/mirrors/perlmutter-spack-develop
